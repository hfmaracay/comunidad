1. Nametags. You can follow this pattern (Orange is for Developers, Blue is for Hustlers, Black is for Designers). If you donâ€™t have the time or budget to print these, you can buy mailing lables instead, though we strictly recommend the nametags with color, to have a clearer view of your attendee's profiles.
2. Prepare your presentation (if you plan on presenting H/F, after the launch we usually do a short presentation of H/F in the next meetups for those who are new to it). Feel free to make a copy of this template.
