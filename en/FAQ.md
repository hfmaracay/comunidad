# FAQ Hackers/Founders

- What is the primary purpose of Hackers / Founders’ gatherings?

To bring together entrepreneurs founding tech startups and businesses; mentors, investors and
supporters; and people who are simply curious into a safe and hospitable space that sparks
collaboration, innovation, partnerships, shared knowledge and the free exchange of ideas.

## Role Description

- What is my official title if I organize a Hackers / Founders chapter?

You may choose between ( City Name ) and Community or Chapter Leader

Your title will follow this format: City Name + Community or Chapter Leader

Ex. Amsterdam Community Leader or Amsterdam Chapter Leader

- How should I title my chapter?

Hackers / Founders ( City Name ). Please do not use Hackers / Founders ( Country Name ) to
leave room for more communities in your country to join up.

- How often should meetups be scheduled?

H/F prefers a once-a-month minimum, although some chapters choose to meet more frequently.

If this is not possible for you, please don’t let 4 months pass by between each event.

- How long does it take me to organize the meetup?

During the first meetups it is likely that the organization will take you 8-10 hours a month plus the event itself. But as your expertise increases, this can take 5 to 6 hours per month.

- Do I need to have a team to run the events?

It’s not obligatory to have a team, but it’s certainly recommended and will make the work much easier. Identify your most dedicated members and ask them to become co-organizers, whom you may train to step into a leadership role when needed. And then delegate as much as is appropriate to ensure they learn the endeavor from the ground up.

## Legal

- Does H/F require a franchise agreement?

Absolutely not. No money changes hands, therefore no licensing agreement is required. We are working on a Memorandum just to preserve H/F’s culture, which has always been about doing what’s right for our community.

- May I establish a local, legal entity for Hackers / Founders or any of its subsidiaries, even if the proposed entity is a non-profit?

No , you may not utilize Hackers / Founders, the HACK Fund or any of our subsidiary names to found your own entity as it may interfere with our plans to expand operations around the globe.

- As an organizer, am I considered to be a Hackers / Founders employee?

At this time, organizers who manage events for Hackers / Founders are considered to be
volunteers. However, organizers receive ongoing opportunities for development and are also eligible for assistance, both individually and for their community.

- It is no longer possible for me to lead the Chapter in mi city, what can I do?

H/F understands that organizers may need to move on. For a smooth transfer of leadership, we ask that you approach your co-organizers first to determine if one would be willing to step up into your role. If not, please ask co-organizers to maintain meetup operations for 6 additional months. During the time that the chapter remains active, a new leader should be identified from the community.

If the chapter is unable to continue operations and/or schedule a meetup for a year or more, H/F may grant the chapter to another individual.
