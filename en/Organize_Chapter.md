## 1.	Hackers / Founders History

**Jonathan and the H/F reunions**

It was the Spring of 2008, in San Jose, California. Laura Nelson had heard quite enough of her aspiring entrepreneur husband Jonathan's nonstop startup-talk. “I love you, Honey, “ she said, but you need to get out of the house! Go meet and talk to other like-minded folks about this stuff.” Shortly after that, Jonathan convened the first “Hackers & Founders” meetup at St. John’s Bar & Grill in Sunnyvale. Five people, including Jonathan, attended.

Within three years, Hackers/Founders had grown into a network of meetups for startup founders all around the world. Hackers/Founders chapters can now be found in 128 cities in 47 countries. In addition to meetups, H/F also hosts educational classes, tech talks and other awesome events.

Following a suggestion by Naval Ravikant of AngelList, the Hackers/Founders Co-op accelerator was launched in 2011 to provide concierge services to early-stage startups under a unique – and in our eyes, superior – business model.

## 2.	Why to organize an H/F chapter

**Make life easier for tech entrepreneurs**

One of the reasons you decided to start your H/F chapter is probably because you experienced a need in your community or decided that something ought to be developed. If nobody else was going to do it, why not do it yourself? After all, where you live has a deep impact in personal life and professional development.

It’s very likely that your community will develop faster and go further if everybody learns together, rather than  if everyone learns on their own. One of the core values of Hackers/Founders is collaboration. Therefore, it is fundamental that you raise awareness of the power of it in your community. ; Sharing experiences, knowledge and even mistakes will help the community to mature more quickly. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of a community that collaborates, Steve Wozniak himself  mentioned that without computer clubs, in which members shared their creations and helped each other, Apple computers would probably not exist.  

On another note, success stories born from your community can encourage more people to get involved and inspire each other in entrepreneurship, creating an unbreakable cycle.

In addition, over the long term, a chapter can bolster the development of a strong startup ecosystem and the creation of wealth and jobs that come along with it.

Simply, the value you invest in your community will pay dividends for everyone who is involved.

**Improve your community**

As you probably know, one of the main goals of H/F is to make entrepreneurs lives suck less. Building something new is hard, and as an entrepreneur, sometimes it can be difficult to find the kind of support you need from friends or family, as they may not be able to understand your experience. So support from a community of founders  is invaluable, and this is another thing that makes H/F great. Through your chapter, people will be able to find individuals with similar interests who don’t think choosing the path of entrepreneurship is crazy. . When things get overwhelming, a community is a safe place to lean on.

H/F Community can also make entrepreneurs lives easier by:

- Finding beta users for their products. Entrepreneurs can find in early adopters in your meetups, as well as feedback from the assistans.

-	Finding talent for their startups. Recruiting is a pain point for founders.

-	Sharing experiences and solutions with other founders and members of the community. Being an entrepreneur can be confusing, especially at the beginning, Why not help out the less experienced?

-	Learning from the mistakes of others. Sharing the failures and tough lessons will help other people avoid those pains.

**Rewards as an organizer**

- Access to H/F’s networks

  By being an H/F leader you automatically have access to a network of H/F community leaders in more than 40 countries, who, in turn, can connect with others in their communities. Likewise, you'll be close to the H / F teams in Silicon Valley, Latin America and Berlin, who can connect you with more people as well.

- Pay it forward

  Another important aspect of H / F is our "Pay it Forward" culture. When you help someone or add value without expecting anything in return, chances are strong that . Once this starts replicating in the community, everyone wins. This was one of the experiences of Mak Gutierrez, founder of the H / F chapter in Guadalajara, one of the  and now Director of H/Mexico. When Mak met Jonathan at one of the usual H/F meetings in San Jose in 2011, Jonathan helped him to connect with a startup who was looking for a designer and Mak got the job at the time. Although he would later move on, this was one of the key moments that caused Mak to decide to organize the H/F chapter in his city, Guadalajara.. One of Mak's goals in bringing H / F to Guadalajara was for people to learn about collaborating without expecting anything in return. Now Guadalajara has the second largest community after H/F Silicon Valley, and  was the first satellite site for the H/F Co-op program.

- Exposure, networking and opportunities

  By becoming the lead organizer and facilitator of connections, you will be the person that everyone will meet, and that is why many opportunities come to you first. On another note,, it will never look bad on your resume that you do pro bono activities, in addition to demonstrating certain qualities, such as being willing to work for what you believe, attention to detail, etc.

- Autonomy

  One of the qualities of H/F is its flexibility as an organization. H/F is confident that the organizers know the needs of their communities and what strategies might best help the ecosystem improve. There is no mandatory program for community leaders  to follow, so they can experiment with different things. Which is also a challenge. However something that is obligatory for an H/F organizer is that he must understand and make others learn about the importance of collaborating and that sharing makes everybody go faster.

**Commitments**

The 4 rules of H/F

As you probably know by now, H/F has 4 major rules:

1.	Don’t be jerk. H/F is all about openness and collaboration, if you aren’t somebody capable of collaborating or you aren’t accessible to people, it’s probable that your efforts as a community leader will not bear fruit.

2.	Do the right thing for your community. The needs of your community are ahead of the interests of other actors in the ecosystem.

3.	If you use the H/F brand, please don’t mess it up. H/F is a brand with global presence that represents tech entrepreneurs, be careful when you use it.

4.	Talk with us about your community. We want to listen what’s good, what’s wrong, and how can we help.

## 3.	Planning the meetup

**Who should come**

As the name of the organization suggests, H/F  attracts technical people. Since inventors, geeks, and programmers make startups, people like that form the backbone of our meetups. But everyone is welcome. If you get the technical people in the door, the business people will follow. 

**Announcement**

Here are some basic guidelines that will help you plan your first meetups. 

- Date

  Let’s start with the date. It is preferable to find a consistent date on which to hold your meetup. If you can tell people that it will be held the 1st Thursday or 3rd Wednesday of the month, that will help your community to remember and more readily commit to attending. he more people that come to your event, the more will want to come and see what is going on. 

  However, before you standardize on a date, research other meetups and activities in your area that might appeal to your audience so that you can minimize any conflicts. Conflicts could result in fewer  people attending your meeting, and it might also create some friction with other communities. We know some cities have several communities and the date might collide with other events, just try that the events it collides with are the ones that won’t affect your audience.
  
  Sporadic dates also work, but try to let your audience know at least 2-3 weeks in advance.

- Venue

  In our experience, some good places for the meetups are bars, co-working spaces, startup offices, just to mention a few. 

- Beer or supplies 

  It’s almost a tradition that in most of our reunions there is free beer. Let’s be honest: most people like beer, and even more so if it’s free.  It also helps to foster a more relaxed, friendly environment and may make it easier for people to connect with each other. Some venues are strict about prohibiting alcohol, but in those cases, you can fall back on free pizza or something similar. Even if an attendee didn’t make an important connection or didn’t learn something from the talk, at least he or she had free beer or pizza. Chances are that person will remember that, and come back next time. Perhaps that will be when they will make that connection or learn that skill.

  Pro tip: don’t serve beer while the speaker is talking, this distracts attendees.

- Speakers

  Once you have the date and place, it is time to choose the appropriate content for the meetup. Remember that another of H/F goals is to educate. When you are booking speakers,, especially in the early stages of launching your chapter, make sure that they have been successful or have certain expertise in an area. Chapter members will want to listen to someone that has already gone through the pains of entrepreneurship and has had success. They don’t want to discover what somebody else already discovered, besides these people can also inspire the audience start they own projects.  Focus on the content, and not the length of the talk. 

  In the beginning, you may be pressed into service as a speaker in addition to your organizer duties.  This goes with the territory, but try not to be the main speaker in all of them, people might get a bit tired of this, and listening to what new speakers have to say is another attraction of the meetup.

- Pitches

  Pitch practice is a regular part of  some H/F meetups, and it is an activity we suggest for everyone. Following  the the main speaker Q&A, make  space for 3 entrepreneurs to give a 3 minutes pitch each of their product. No more than 3 entrepreneurs and 3 minutes each since you don’t want to extend the presentations for much more time. 

  Oing this gives local entrepreneurs the chance to be more recognized in the community, express some of their needs, and get feedback from the community as well.

- Social Media

  To promote your meetup we strongly recommend having at least one social media account on Facebook or Twitter, and also having Eventbrite or a similar platform so your members can register for the event. The platform you use to manage registration for your event is really important.  Before choosing one to go with, make sure you will be able to own the attendees information. The database  of your members is one of the most important resources you will build as an organizer. First, because it’s one of the main way to be in contact with them, you can send them information about the next meetups, doing surveys for feedback of the event, etc. 

  You can also see who is going to your meetups;  is it more designers than engineers? More engineers than hustlers? Who isn’t going? This way you can also develop strategies.

  Don’t worry too much if many of the people that registered doesn’t attend the event, this is something that happens frequently.

  When you are writing the details about your event, try to be descriptive as possible about what will happen at the event. If there is insufficient information, it might not appear to be of interest to your possible attendees. Once your event is ready, do some interesting, short and descriptive posts on social media, being sure to share the link to register. 

  Don’t focus too much in the quantity of attendees, especially in the first several meetings. Is more important to attract the right people that will add value to the community. Try to have the right “early adopters”, and the community will be stronger when it starts to grow.

## 4.	During the meetup

As the organizer and leader, it is important to ask your members, “What do you need?” This simple question can lead to giving advice or feedback, or connecting them with someone who might help them out. This could also help you find certain patterns or general needs of the community, which can help you develop relevant topics for your meetups.  Since collaboration is one of the core values of H/F, you should also invite your community members to ask this question to each other. This way this practice can replicate easily throughout the community.

Among the most basic and yet most helpful resources for meetups are nametags. Nametags are great for networking for two reasons. Firstly, it takes the fear of not remembering someone’s name out of the equation. The second one is that by dividing the nametags into different backgrounds, people have a clearer idea of who might help them out more easily. To that end, we suggest you divide the name tags in colors for different profiles, for example: orange= technical/devs; blue = business/ hustlers; black = designers or creatives. We also recommend you divide the profiles when create your registration page as ticket types.
